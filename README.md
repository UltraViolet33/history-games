# History Games

This is a personal project. Being passionate about History, I would like to create more games / quizz / educational content about History.

This project is for now about french Kings, Queens, famous writers and battles.

I intend to keep adding content this app on the future and add different kind of game too.

I use React and the [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) library for the Drag and Drop feature.
